      <p className="text-gray-800">Happiness is contagious, and at CareCycle, we believe in spreading it far and wide. Our vision is to build a community where everyone has access to menstrual hygiene products and support, enabling them to lead happier, healthier lives. By working together, we can create a ripple effect of positivity, compassion, and joy, making a lasting impact on the lives of girls and women in need.</p>
      <p className="text-gray-800 mb-8">
        We invite you to join us in our mission to create a world where no one has to compromise their health or dignity due to a lack of access to menstrual hygiene products. Together, we can make a difference one pad at a time.
